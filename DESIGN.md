# Design Guideline

This document describes a design guideline for the group throughout the project. The guideline is
divided into several phases, where each phase is filled in at appropriate times in the project. The
document is not final, and is updated when the group needs to make formal design decisions.

## Concept phase

### Theme

The group will aim for a playful design, meaning the design will not be too plain or bland, but
have elements that make the overall experience of the website unique and exciting.

### Color scheme

The company does not have a color scheme, meaning the group is responsible of creating one.

The colors suggested by the playful theme is up for interpretation, however the group found green
to be the most fitting color, as green us usually associated with nature, and the company wants the
design to give a sense of adventure.

Main color: Green\
Accent color: Yellow-green

### Hierarchy and layout

#### Landing page

The most important message on this page is the search function.

The order of importance will thus be
1. the search bar 
2. the search button
3. the navigation bar

The sections on the page will be the hero section and the navigation bar.

The layout the group will use is a page containing only a hero section with a navigation bar on top
of it.

#### Main page

The most important message on this page are the cars displayed for rental.

The order of importance will thus be 
1. The cars for rental section,
2. The card in the cars for
rental section, 
3. The rental information section, 
4. The rent button in the rental information
section and 
5. The navigation bar.

The sections on the page will be the cars for rental section, the rental information section and
the navigation bar.

The layout the group will is a scrolling cars for rental section to the left and a rental
information section to the right, with a navigation bar on top of them.

### Images

There will be text aside appropriate images (e.g. images of cars but mot background images).

The group will use clear images.

Use of blurred images will be avoided.

### Icons

The group will use icons for different purposes. These may be searching, logging in, and viewing
information about cars. E.g. a person symbol may be used to indicate how many seats are in a car.

Both colored and black-and-white/greyscale icons will be used, depending on the purpose of the
icon.

### Typography

A sans-serif font will be used. 

Bold style will be used.

Rounded edges will be used to accommodate for the playful theme.

### Border rounding

The edges should be quite rounded according to the playful theme, meaning they should be rounded
enough to have an impact on the overall design.

### Shadows

The group will in general use slight shadowing to accommodate for the playful theme.
