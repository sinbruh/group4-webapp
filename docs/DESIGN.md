# Design Guideline

This document describes a design guideline for the group throughout the project. The guideline is
divided into several phases, where each phase is filled in at appropriate times in the project. The
document is not final, and is updated when the group needs to make formal design decisions.

## Concept phase

### Theme

The group will aim for a playful design, meaning the design will not be too plain or bland, but
have elements that make the overall experience of the website unique and exciting.

### Color scheme

The company does not have a color scheme, meaning the group is responsible of creating one.

The colors suggested by the playful theme is up for interpretation, however the group found green
to be the most fitting color, as green us usually associated with nature, and the company wants the
design to give a sense of adventure.

Main color: Green\
Accent color: Yellow-green

### Hierarchy and layout

#### Landing page

The most important message on this page is the search function.

The order of importance will thus be:

1. The search bar 
2. The search button
3. The navigation bar

The sections on the page will be the hero section and the navigation bar.

The layout the group will use is a page containing only a hero section with a navigation bar on top
of it.

#### Main page

The most important message on this page are the cars displayed for rental.

The order of importance will thus be:

1. The 'cars for rental' section
2. The card in the 'cars for rental' section
3. The 'rental information' section, 
4. The rent button in the 'rental information' section
5. The navigation bar

The sections on the page will be the 'cars for rental' section, the 'rental information' section and
the navigation bar.

The layout the group will use is a scrolling 'cars for rental' section to the left and a 'rental
information' section to the right, with a navigation bar on top of them.

### Images

There will be text aside appropriate images (e.g. images of cars but mot background images).

The group will use clear images.

Use of blurred images will be avoided.

### Icons

The group will use icons for different purposes. These may be searching, logging in, and viewing
information about cars. E.g. a person symbol may be used to indicate how many seats are in a car.

Both colored and black-and-white/greyscale icons will be used, depending on the purpose of the
icon.

### Typography

A sans-serif font will be used. 

Bold style will be used.

Rounded edges will be used to accommodate for the playful theme.

### Border rounding

The edges should be quite rounded according to the playful theme, meaning they should be rounded
enough to have an impact on the overall design.

### Shadows

The group will in general use slight shadowing to accommodate for the playful theme.

## Specific Technical  Desicions phase

### Color Scheme

the original colorscheme was based on the previous theme playful and adventurous: green for the base color and yellow-green shade for buttons and such, showed in initial website concept designs. However, due to poor visability and contrast towards white backgrounds for colorblind individuals, the group decided to stray away from this desicion to a more dark blue/black design that is more user friendly. 

### Typography

The use of semi bold for titles and text that was more important to display was implemented. 

### Hierarchy and layout

Hierarchy and layout stated in the original concept design has not changed or varied much, as the group has stayed true to the original statement. Refer to the Hierarchy and Layout section in the original concept design. 

#### Landing page

Landing page priorities is:

1. The search bar 
2. The search button
3. The navigation bar which includes home,
   about, contact and more importantly the profile page linking

#### Main page

Again, the idea here has not changed from the original concept and has stayed true.

The order of importance is:

1. The 'cars for rental' section
2. The card in the 'cars for rental' section
3. The 'rental information' section, 
4. The rent button in the 'rental information' section
5. The navigation bar

The sections on the page will be the 'cars for rental' section, the 'rental information' section and
the navigation bar.

#### Profile page

There is one additional page that is included during the design phase, which is the profile page.
Here the order of importance is:

1. Profile/account information
2. List of bookings or a reciept of orders made by the user
3. Other tabs that only the admin has access to, such as car editor, list of all users and list of orders placed by everyone in total.


### Icons

The group has used a relativly wide variety of icons, mainly used by the provided icons library but also
includes UI component libraries such as shadcn. The group mainly used the https://ionic.io/ionicons website to use icons. 


### Spacing

We used a consistant spacing scale to maintain a balanced layout for our website, so no specific spacing was decided.

### Border Rounding

The group has stayed true to this original concept design aswell, 
where everything such as buttons and cards has rounded edges
to fit the theme. Even though the colors had to be swapped, the group has tried 
to stay true to the theme, granted some changes in design during development phase.
