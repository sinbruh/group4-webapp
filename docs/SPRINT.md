# Sprints

This document describes the sprints done by the group throughout the project. The sprints are
mainly conducted as described in SCRUM to assure agile workflow.

## Week 6

This sprint starts in week 6 and ends in week 7.

Deadline: 15.02.2024

### Goals

The goals of this sprint is to (1) fill in the conceptual phase of the design guideline, (2) make
the first version of the wireframes and (3) make a document for sprint reports.

Issues related to the goals:

1. Fill in conceptual phase in design guideline
2. Create first version of wireframes
3. Create document for sprint reports

### Work distribution

There is no set work distribution for this sprint. All group members are responsible to reach the
goals of this sprint.

### Accomplishments

All the goals set by the group for this sprint was accomplished; the conceputal phase in the design
guideline was filled in, the first version of the wireframes was made, as well as the document for
sprint reports. Even though the conceptual phase of the design guideline was filled in, the group
expects to update it later on in the project.

The group thinks the only point of improvement for the next sprint is to work more consistently.

## Week 7

This sprint starts in week 7 and ends in week 8.

Deadline: 20.02.2024

### Goals

The goals of this sprint is to (1) create the use-case diagram, (2) create the database schema, (3)
continue working on the wireframes and (4) create the HTML skeleton for the project.

Issues related to the goals:

1. Create use-case diagram
2. Create database schema
3. Continue working on wireframes
4. Create HTML skeleton

### Work distribution

The work is slightly distributed for this sprint, meaning certain group members is responsible to
reach certain goals of this sprint:

1. Sindre is responsible for the use-case diagram and the HTML skeleton for the project
2. Mathias and Mats are responsible for continuing the work on the wireframes
3. Leander is responsible for the database schema

Even though group members have different responsibilites, all members should contribute to reaching
the goals of the sprint.

### Accomplishments

All the goals set by the group for this sprint was accomplished; the use-case diagram and database
schema was created, the work on the wireframes was continued, and the HTML skeleton for the project
was created. None of the things worked on in the sprint is considered done, meaning the group
expects to work more on these things throughout the project. E.g. even though the use-case diagram
and database schema was created in the sprint, these expected to be worked more on in the project.

The gorup thinks the point of improvement for the next sprint is to work more dynamically, meaning
that even though group members might have different responsibilities in the sprint, each member
should actively contribute to each responsibility.
