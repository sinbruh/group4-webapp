# Sprints

This document describes the sprints done by the group throughout the project. The sprints are
mainly conducted as described in SCRUM to assure agile workflow.

## Week 6

This sprint starts in week 6 and ends in week 7.

Deadline: 15.02.2024

### Goals

The goals of this sprint is to fill in the conceptual phase of the design guideline, make the first
version of the wireframes and make a document for sprint reports.

### Work distribution

There is no set work distribution for this sprint. All group members are responsible to reach the
goals of this sprint.

### Accomplishments

All the goals set by the group for this sprint was accomplished; the conceptual phase in the design
guideline was filled in, the first version of the wireframes was made, as well as the document for
sprint reports. Even though the conceptual phase of the design guideline was filled in, the group
expects to update it later on in the project.

### Retrospective

The group decided the only point of improvement for the next sprint is to work more consistently.

## Week 7

This sprint starts in week 7 and ends in week 8.

Deadline: 20.02.2024

### Goals

The goals of this sprint is to create the use-case diagram, create the database schema, continue
working on the wireframes and create the HTML skeleton for the project.

### Work distribution

The work is slightly distributed for this sprint, meaning certain group members is responsible to
reach certain goals of this sprint:

1. Sindre is responsible for the use-case diagram and the HTML skeleton for the project
2. Mathias and Mats are responsible for continuing the work on the wireframes
3. Leander is responsible for the database schema

Even though group members have different responsibilities, all members should contribute to reaching
the goals of the sprint.

### Accomplishments

All the goals set by the group for this sprint was accomplished; the use-case diagram and database
schema was created, the work on the wireframes was continued, and the HTML skeleton for the project
was created. None of the things worked on in the sprint is considered done, meaning the group
expects to work more on these things throughout the project. E.g. even though the use-case diagram
and database schema was created in the sprint, these expected to be worked more on in the project.

### Retrospective

The group thinks the point of improvement for the next sprint is to work more dynamically, meaning
that even though group members might have different responsibilities in the sprint, each member
should actively contribute to each responsibility.

## Week 11

This sprint starts in week 11 and ends in week 12.

Deadline: 21.03.2024

### Goals

The goals of this sprint is to complete the static pages of the website, make wireframes for
responsive versions of the website, create entity classes for the website and create an SQL
database according to the entity classes.

### Work distribution

The work is slightly distributed for this sprint, meaning certain group members is responsible to
reach certain goals of this sprint:

1. Mats is responsible for completing the static pages of the website
2. Mathias is responsible for making wireframes for responsive versions of the website
3. Mathias and Sindre are responsible for making entity classes for the website
4. Leander is responsible for creating an SQL database according to the entity classes

Even though group members have different responsibilities, all members should contribute to reaching
the goals of the sprint.

### Accomplishments

All the goals set by the group for this sprint was accomplished to some degree; the static pages of
the website were completed except for the search page, wireframes for responsive versions of the
website were made for mobile versions, entity classes for the website were created, and an SQL
database was created according to the entity classes. The static pages of the website and the
wireframes for responsive versions are not considered done, meaning the group expects to work more
on these things throughout the project.

### Retrospective

The group has gotten better at working more dynamically since the last sprint, but still feels like
this is a point of improvement for the next sprint. Even though group members might have different
responsibilities in the sprint, each member should actively contribute to each responsibility.

The group had a checkpoint meeting at the end of this sprint. The feedback the group got from the
lecturers was that the database should not contain array values. Instead, separate tables should be
made to set the relation between many values.

## Week 15

This sprint starts in week 15 and ends in week 16.

Deadline: 19.04.2024

### Goals

The goals of this sprint is to add security to the website, fetch car information from the backend
and display it on the website and begin implementing React to the project.

### Work distribution

The work is slightly distributed for this sprint, meaning certain group members is responsible to
reach certain goals of this sprint:

1. Mats is responsible for adding security to the website
2. Leander is responsible for fetching car information from the backend and displaying it on the
   website
3. Mathias and Sindre are responsible for beginning implementing React to the project

Even though group members have different responsibilities, all members should contribute to reaching
the goals of the sprint.

### Accomplishments

All the goals set by the group for this sprint was either accomplished or accomplished to some
degree; the group began implementing React to the project, but was only able to begin adding
security to the website and begin fetching car information from the backend and displaying it on
the website. The reason for this was that the group had not completely designed the database
according to the project theme description, so the group had to deal with this in order to load the
necessary data to the database, which again was supposed to be fetched as car information.

### Retrospective

The group has gotten well at working more dynamically, and is satisfied with the workflow. The
group even discussed how the work of each group member could help the other members. Some of the
group members were unsatisfied with the amount of work that was put into the project over the
sprint, while others felt like they worked a lot. Because of this, the only point of improvement
for the next sprint is to distribute the workload better among the group members.

## Week 16

This sprint starts in week 16 and ends in week 17.

Deadline: 26.04.2024

### Goals

The goals of this sprint is to finish adding security to the website, continue fetching car
information from the backend and displaying it on the website and continue implementing React to
the project.

### Work distribution

The work is slightly distributed for this sprint, meaning certain group members is responsible to
reach certain goals of this sprint:

1. Mats is responsible for finishing adding security to the website
2. Leander is responsible for continuing fetching car information from the backend and displaying
   it on the website
3. Mathias and Sindre are responsible for continuing implementing React to the project

Even though group members have different responsibilities, all members should contribute to reaching
the goals of the sprint.

### Accomplishments

All the goals set by the group for this sprint was accomplished; the group finished adding security
to the website, made much progress in fetching car information from the backend, but still needs to
display it on the website, and made progess in implementing React to the project. Even though the
group finished adding security, they expect to change this throughout the rest of the project, as
they are very likely to add or remove endpoints later.

### Retrospective

The group is still working weekly on the project and is satisfied with the workflow. The group
still feel like the workload could be distributed better amoung the group members, and that the
uneven workload could be caused by too vauge goals distributed among the members. If the goals were
more precise and had clearer points of accomplishment, the group members would perhaps work more
directed towards finishing the goals they were responsible of. Because of this, the point of
improvement for the next sprint is to make more precise goals that have clear points of
accomplishment.

## Week 17

This sprint starts in week 17 and ends in week 18.

Deadline: 03.05.2024

a React modal for user operations, and they converted most of the search bar in the landing page to
React and styled it using Tailwind CSS.

### Retrospective

The group is still working weekly on the project and is satisfied with the workflow. The group feel
like the workload has been distributed better since the last sprint, and thinks this is caused by
